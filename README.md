# Shahnameh
This is a transliteration derived from the Tajiki version of Shahnameh, in 6 volumes.
I have added some titles in English using %%.
The text includes aproximately the first half of Shahnameh, Corresponding to the first 4 books of Khaleghi's edition and few sections of book 5. This would be somewhere around the story of Go≈°tasp and Katayun under the reign of Kay Lohrasp.
